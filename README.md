## Task 1: Simple Registration Form Using Tkinter
This project demonstrates the fundamentals of GUI development using the Tkinter library in Python. The form includes the following fields:
- Name
- Email
- Age

### Files:
- `registration_form.py`: Main script containing the Tkinter GUI for the registration form.

## Task 2: Building a Chatbot Using Python
This project involves creating a responsive and interactive chatbot using Python. Various libraries and techniques are explored to build a chatbot capable of engaging with users effectively.

### Files:
- `chatbot.py`: Main script for the chatbot implementation.

## Task 3: Creating GUI to Extract Lyrics from Songs Using Python
This project focuses on designing a GUI application that extracts lyrics from songs. It integrates APIs or web scraping techniques to fetch lyrics and display them on the interface.

### Files:
- `lyrics_extractor_gui.py`: Main script containing the GUI application for lyrics extraction.
